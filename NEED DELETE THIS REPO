Dear friend,


I can see that you have a repo name cpp_book.
In 2016, I'm the first person who created and uploaded all books and documents on this repo, after that some people forked it. 
But I got a warning about copyright and then I deleted my repo, but the forked repo still exists.
Now, I'm facing a really serious problem with legal and copyright law.
In some cases, an investigation could be open about this repo, and that bad for me, and maybe make some trouble for you both. 
Big trouble for me. 
The only thing I could ask you is to delete the repo cpp_book on your GitHub page. 
In bad cases, you don't delete it, then maybe some big company own copyright still can do it, and they will ask GitHub delete your repo. It means, your repo sill will be deleted in the future. But in this case, I will get some trouble with legal and security.But it's completely up to you.Please help me and delete the repo, it's violating the copyright.If not, many trouble will come with me, so now I'm trying to email with all persons who forked the repo cpp_book to ask them to delete this repo.
I hope you understand and delete the repo cpp_book.Your action will help me a lot.
Thank you and best regards,
